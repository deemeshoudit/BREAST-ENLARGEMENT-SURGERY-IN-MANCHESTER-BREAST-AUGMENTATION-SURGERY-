Breast augmentation (enlargement) is a surgical operation whereby the breast is made larger to create an enhanced cosmetic outcome. This is usually achieved by inserting a prosthetic implant.  This is usually done through a short incision through the skin at the base of the breast. The resulting scar is then hidden under the mound of the breast. Occasionally, this may be also be done through an incision at the edge of the areolar (the circular disc of pigmented skin surrounding the nipple).  The breast implants are either placed under the breast or under the muscle of the chest. The appropriate plane for implant displacement depends on the size and volume of the breast preoperatively.
